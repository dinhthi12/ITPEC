# Add Binary Explanation

## Initialize Pointers and Carry:
1. Set `i` to the last index of string `a` (`a.length() - 1`).
2. Set `j` to the last index of string `b` (`b.length() - 1`).
3. Initialize `carry = 0` to keep track of any carryover during addition.

## Loop Until All Digits and Carry Are Processed:
- Continue looping while there are digits to process in either string (`i >= 0 || j >= 0`) or if there is a carry (`carry == 1`).

## Add Bits from `a` and `b` to Carry:
- If `i >= 0`, add the current bit of string `a` (from the `i`th position) to carry and then decrement `i`.
- If `j >= 0`, add the current bit of string `b` (from the `j`th position) to carry and then decrement `j`.

## Calculate Current Bit of the Result:
- Append `(carry % 2)` to the result. This calculates the current binary bit (either `0` or `1`) for this position.

## Update Carry:
- Update carry to be either `0` or `1` by dividing the current carry value by `2` (`carry /= 2`), which shifts the carry to the next position.

## Repeat:
- Continue the loop until all bits and the carry are processed.

## Return the Result:
- Since the result is built in reverse order (from the least significant bit to the most significant), reverse the `StringBuilder` and return the final binary sum as a string.
