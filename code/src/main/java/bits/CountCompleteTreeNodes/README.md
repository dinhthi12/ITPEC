# Count Complete Tree Nodes
This algorithm counts the number of nodes in a complete binary tree.

## Problem Description
Given the root of a complete binary tree, the task is to count the total number of nodes in the tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

## Initialize
1. Check if the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `null`). If it is, return 0, as there are no nodes to count.

## Algorithm
1. Define a recursive function that takes a node as input.
2. If the node is `null`, return 0.
3. Count the node itself (adding 1).
4. Recursively count all nodes in the left subtree by calling the function on `node.left`.
5. Recursively count all nodes in the right subtree by calling the function on `node.right`.
6. Return the total count, which is the sum of the current node count, the left subtree count, and the right subtree count.

## Return the Result
 Once the recursion completes, return the total count of nodes, which includes the root node and all its descendants.
